# Falmouth Academy Science Fair - Wave Attenuation

Angular frequency

Sine curves
A sine curve is defined by four variables:
Period (T) or frequency (f = 1/T)
Amplitude (a)
Phase (phi)
Time (t)

z = a*cos( omega * t + phi

Addition of sine curves
Sine curves can be added together to form more complicated time series
Special examples:
    Square wave
    Sawtooth wave
