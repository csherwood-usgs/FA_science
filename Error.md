### Propagation of error

It is super important to have a feel for the uncertainty in your measurements.  

When you know the uncertainty of some measurement $x$, you can state the uncertainty as $x\pm\delta x$, where $\delta x$ is the uncertainty.   

If you have many measurements of something, you typically report the mean (average) as your best guess of $x$, and the standard deviation as your value of $\delta x$.  

"Propagating" uncertainty means combining several sources of uncertainty to get the total value. So, for example, if you are 
are measuring speed by timing how fast Usain Bolt runs a 100 m, you might have three stop watches with mean value of $t$ = 9.58 s, but a standard deviation of $\delta t$ = 0.02 s.  So his time is 9.58 $\pm$ 0.02 s. 

But lets imagine that the track measurement is not exact...a little bit of slop in where the finish line laser is located...say 2 millimeters or 0.002 m. So the distance he ran is 100 $\pm$ 0.002 m. 
That adds some more uncertainty to our calculation of his speed.

#### Interupting the lecture on propagation of error to discuss: How many significant digits to report?

His speed is 100 m / 9.58 = 10.4384133612 m/s. But, since we know our timing accuracy is only $\pm$ 0.02 s, it doesn't make sense to report all of those significant digits. 
The guideline is: **Report the result to the same decimal place as its uncertainty.** So, we would report
