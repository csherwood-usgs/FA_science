### Git cheat sheet - the commands you need once it is installed

Remember, you need to run these commands from the folder containing your local copy of the repo.  

You can confirm you are in a folder with a repo if you type `ls -a` and see a "hidden" folder called `.git`.  

The workflow is this:

`cd <folder with repo` **before** you start work, 

`git status`- just a check...might say that *orgin* is ahead of your local repo.
